Wanted to make a web site builder that could be used for a Magazine template.
Wix and Wordpress etc do this pretty good already, but didnt want to be tied down with their hostings and extra frills their templates seem to come with.
 

## Salient Requirements of the site
1. Make a site that combines best of SPA and PWA [Single Page Application and Progressive Web App]. For e.g. if this is a Magazine the SPA will have multiple "articles"
2. An easy access via a "Table of Contents", to go to any "article"
3. Ability for each "article" to have its own layout/colorscheme/fonts etc. So that this looks rich, more like a pdf than a blog, i.e all blog posts follow the same layout.
Other salient features for maintenance purpose were
4. Ease of editing. ie. adding/delete reorder articles. Changes to individual articles shouldn't mess up others
5. The layouts/images etc to smartly reorganize to be tablet/cell and PC screen aspect ratios.

The source is pretty sparce and is just index.html. 
The dependencies [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) and [w3.js](https://www.w3schools.com/w3js/) help solve 4, 5, are included in the src folder
