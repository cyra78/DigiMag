# NOTES
1.```#refs``` for ```<a href``` for side bar navigation can be from inside the article pages too.
For simplicity they are set for the w3-include-html tag in index.html
Also an article can have multiple #hrefs for content lookup as well
2. 2 types of sidebar closingnav and notclosingnavs js functions in index.html

# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR "ARTICLE" EDITORS
1. no article pages can have titles except for index.html
2. no article pages can have styles on body.
3. As much as possible no scripts needed in articles htmls. They work but lets keep only for rarest of rarest
No styles that are not from w3 css as much as possible
4. Use multi column views only when the columns fit into height of turned landscape cell.
Dont depend on how it looks on the PC.
Add a ```<hr>``` or image below the columns if there are more columns below  
Maybe need to look deeper into flxbox and grid css
5. Have samples, Have reference to important samples from w3
